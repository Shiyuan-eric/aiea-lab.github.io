Shiyuan Huang is a Master's student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at UC Santa Cruz, under the supervision of [Dr. Leilani Gilpin](https://people.ucsc.edu/~lgilpin/). His research primarily revolves around the explainability of AI and NLP models, with a specific focus on the interpretability of Large Language Models (LLM).

His recent research papers is titled ["Can Large Language Models Explain Themselves? A Study of LLM-Generated Self-Explanations"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.11207.pdf).
